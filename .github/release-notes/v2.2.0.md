## What's New

Export method prompt is shown irrespective of available exporters.

Previously, when no game-specific exporter was available, the generic exporter was automatically selected without prompting the user. Now users are always prompted to confirm their export method choice, even when only the generic exporter option is available.

This improves transparency and gives users explicit control over the export process.
