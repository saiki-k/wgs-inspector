# Release Notes

This directory contains release notes for each version.

Create a new markdown file named after the version tag (e.g., `v2.1.0.md`) with corresponding release notes.

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically include these notes in the release draft.

## Example

For version `v2.1.0`, create `v2.1.0.md`:

```markdown
